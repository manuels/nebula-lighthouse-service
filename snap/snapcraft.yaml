  This snap offers a public Nebula VPN Lighthouse Service.
  You run it to offer people who do not have a publicly accessible server a way to run their own Nebula Lighthouse.

  Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security.
  It lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows.
  (Also: keep this quiet, but we have an early prototype running on iOS).
  It can be used to connect a small number of computers, but is also able to connect tens of thousands of computers.

  Nebula incorporates a number of existing concepts like encryption, security groups, certificates,
  and tunneling, and each of those individual pieces existed before Nebula in various forms.
  What makes Nebula different to existing offerings is that it brings all of these ideas together,
  resulting in a sum that is greater than its individual parts.
